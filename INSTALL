Vulnero is a WordPress plugin that transforms WordPress into an 
object-oriented CMS by implementing a Zend Framework application 
that interfaces with its API.

This directory is the core library which can be installed in an
existing Zend Framework application by copying this directory
into a library sub-directory and ensuring it's in your 
include_path and that your project uses auto-loading.

Secondly, you'll need to copy the wordpress-plugin.php file to
your application's root directory. You may also want to edit
this file to better describe your plugin.

Finally, copy your entire application into WordPress' 
'wp-content/plugins' directory.

Now, when you login to WordPress as an administrator, you should 
see your plugin in the list and have the option to activate it.
